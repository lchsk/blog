    <h1>Launching applications from Emacs</h1>
    Published 2018-08-27
    <div id="text" style="max-width: 760px;">
      <p>I spent a lot of time in Emacs so I'm always looking for something new to add to my workflow. I typically start applications using <a href="https://github.com/lchsk/xstarter"><strong>xstarter</strong></a>, a command line tool written in C that uses an <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/">ncurses</a> interface. It allows me to quickly search an open programs I need. One of its useful features is recording applications that were recently opened and showing them on the screen so that they can be accessed quickly. Most of the time, I use it via <a href="https://xmonad.org/"><code>xmonad</code> window manager</a> where it's configured to launch with a <a href="https://github.com/lchsk/dotfiles/blob/master/xmonad.hs#L133">key shortcut</a>.</p>

<p><em>List of recently opened applications in terminal</em></p>
<p>However, I also wanted to have access to that tool via Emacs so that I can use it even if I'm not running <code>xmonad</code>. I wrote a small <a href="https://github.com/lchsk/helm-xstarter"><strong>Emacs Lisp</strong> package</a> that offers an interface for <strong>xstarter</strong>. It uses <a href="https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm">Helm</a>, a great framework for building convenient search interfaces that many Emacs users are familiar with.</p>

<p><em>Emacs interface for <code>xstarter</code></em></p>
<p>In order to make it work, I had to add two additional features to <code>xstarter</code> itself. Firstly, it needs to return a list of applications it has stored in cache. It's printed to the standard output; in order to get it, the Lisp package simply runs <code>xstarter -P</code> as a shell command and collects the output as a string. Secondly, I've added <code>xstarter -e</code> option which can launch any application in a separate process (so if it's run from a terminal, it's detached from it). The ELisp package uses that command to launch an application selected by a user in the Emacs interface:</p>
<pre><code>(defun helm-xstarter-open (arg)
  (shell-command (concat &quot;xstarter -e&quot; arg)))
</code></pre>
<p>It's surprisingly short at just over <a href="https://github.com/lchsk/helm-xstarter/blob/master/helm-xstarter.el">20 lines of code</a>!</p>
