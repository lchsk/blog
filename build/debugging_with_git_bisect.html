    <h1>Debugging with git bisect</h1>

      <p>One of the projects I've been working on and off for some time is <a href="https://github.com/lchsk/derid">derid</a>. It's terminal file manager which wraps <code>ls</code> command and provides the information in the same format but in an interactive fashion. As the name suggests, it's inspired by <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html">dired</a>, the file manager that comes with Emacs (<code>derid</code> being an ananym of <code>dired</code>).</p>
<p>It's still in early development so it doesn't have many features you would expect from a file manager yet.</p>
<p>After doing a little bit of clean up and refactoring recently, I've noticed that the application crashes when requested to show some directories. I've introduced a number of changes in different commits recently and I wasn't sure which one was the culprit so I decided to use `git bisect** to identify the one that had introduced the bug.</p>
<p>In this kind of situation you would ideally have an idea where an issue might have been introduced. But with a larger number of commits and if more time has passed it might be very time consuming. Also, a brute-force approach of testing each revision takes a long time, too.</p>
<h2>How to use <code>git bisect</code>?</h2>
<p><code>git bisect</code> uses binary search to reduce the number of commits that need to be tested to find the buggy commit.</p>
<p>You start by moving to the root of the repository.</p>
<p>Then, you initialise by running</p>
<p><code>$ git bisect start</code></p>
<p>After that, we need to provide two commit hashes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>bad</code>: where we know the bug exists</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>good</code>: last known version without the bug</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In my case, it was:</p>
<p><code>$ git bisect bad 0c898b0</code></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><code>$ git bisect good a54d699</code></p>
<p>Git will check out version at the commit between <code>good</code> and <code>bad</code> and inform you how many iterations are expected:</p>
<p><code>Bisecting: 5 revisions left to test after this (roughly 3 steps)</code>.</p>
<p>You need to test your code and then run:</p>
<p><code>$ git bisect good</code> if the bug is gone, or</p>
<p><code>$ git bisect bad</code> if the bug is still there.</p>
<p>Git will narrow down the range of suspicious revisions and you'll get to test it again. After a few iterations of this process, git should identify the commit that had introduced the bug:</p>
<p><img src="data/git_bisect_bad_commit.png" alt="Bad commit identified with git bisect" /></p>
<p><em>Bad commit identified with git bisect</em></p>
<p>Having confirmed the bug originated in that commit, you can finish the process by</p>
<p><code>$ git bisect reset</code>.</p>
<p>We can also take a look at <code>git log</code> to see which commits we have looked at:</p>
<p><img src="data/git_bisect_log.png" alt="Revisions tested with git bisect" /></p>
<p><em>Revisions tested with <code>git bisect</code></em></p>
<p>We can see which commits were investigated and which ones we omitted to save some time. <code>git bisect</code> is a useful debugging tool and a great example of practical use of binary search.</p>
