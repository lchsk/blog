## Alive: the game

### Submission for Ludum Dare 46

- [**Play the game online**](alive_game)

The theme this time was 'Keep it alive'. I have decided to consider it literally and create a survival game. The main character is being attacked by an endless wave of enemies. The player must keep him alive as long as possible (although he will eventually succumb as there's no actual way of winning).

## Knight General

### Turn-based strategy for Ludum Dare 42. 
Theme: Running out of space

Knight General is inspired by classic turn-based strategy games. The aim of the game is to control the whole map (so that the enemy 'runs out of space'). To do so, a player can move their units into enemy territory, thus increasing their possessions. Each player can buy more units, all of which can fight the enemies and collect resources. Units are bought with coins, which each player collects by:

- gathering resources
- receiving a payout at the beginning of each turn, which depends on the size of owned land

## Pimp my tank

### A video game created for GitHub Game Off 2016
Theme is Hacking, Modding, or Augmenting

The aim of the game is to control your tank and hit other players' (human or computer controlled) tanks. The user the modify his/her tank (by buying new weapons, changing tank's colour) as well as alter the environment (by changing the wind speed which makes shooting missiles quite tricky).
